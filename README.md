### üéØ Attendance Management
- **Real-time Attendance**: Students can mark attendance using face recognition
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple attendance entries for the same day
- **Verification Status**: Tracks whether attendance was verified by face recognition
- **Attendance History**: Complete attendance history for both students and admins

### üë• Student Management
- **Student Registration**: Add students with photo and face data
- **Photo Upload**: Support for both camera capture and file upload
- **Face Data Extraction**: Automatic face feature extraction during registration
- **Student Dashboard**: Individual student attendance statistics

### üìä Admin Dashboard
- **Real-time Statistics**: Total students, present/absent counts
- **Attendance Details**: Detailed view of today's attendance
- **Student List**: Complete list of registered students
- **Configuration**: Toggle student authentication on/off

## Technical Improvements

### Authentication Fixes
1. **Rate Limiting Enhancement**:
   - Added `lockoutUntil` property to prevent login attempts during lockout period
   - Improved error handling for Appwrite rate limit errors (code 429)
   - Better user feedback with remaining lockout time

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Specific error messages for different failure types
   - Proper session cleanup on logout
   - Graceful handling of network errors

### Face Recognition Improvements
1. **Enhanced Face Detection**:
   - Multiple detection algorithms for better accuracy
   - Retry mechanism for model loading
   - Timeout handling for image processing

2. **Improved Matching Algorithm**:
   - Stricter threshold (0.4) for better security
   - Confidence scoring with additional verification
   - Better error messages for failed matches

3. **Face Data Management**:
   - Proper storage of face descriptors in Appwrite
   - Validation of face detection during registration
   - Fallback mechanisms when face recognition is unavailable

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Async/await pattern throughout
   - Proper resource cleanup (camera streams)
   - Efficient data loading and caching

3. **User Experience**:
   - Real-time feedback during operations
   - Progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Clear success/error messages

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Appwrite account and project
- Modern web browser with camera access
- Internet connection for Face-API.js models

### Configuration
1. Update Appwrite configuration in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   const client = new Client()
     .setEndpoint('YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT')
     .setProject('YOUR_PROJECT_ID');
   ```

2. Update database and collection IDs:
   ```javascript
   const DATABASE_ID = 'YOUR_DATABASE_ID';
   const STUDENTS_COLLECTION_ID = 'YOUR_STUDENTS_COLLECTION_ID';
   const ATTENDANCE_COLLECTION_ID = 'YOUR_ATTENDANCE_COLLECTION_ID';
   const CONFIG_COLLECTION_ID = 'YOUR_CONFIG_COLLECTION_ID';
   const STORAGE_BUCKET_ID = 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID';
   ```

### Database Schema

#### Students Collection
```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "roll": "string",
  "photoUrl": "string",
  "faceDescriptor": "array",
  "registeredAt": "string",
  "status": "string"
}
```

#### Attendance Collection
```json
{
  "studentRoll": "string",
  "studentId": "string",
  "date": "string",
  "timestamp": "string",
  "method": "string",
  "verified": "boolean",
  "confidence": "string"
}
```

#### Config Collection
```json
{
  "studentAuthEnabled": "boolean"
}
```

## Usage

### Admin Operations
1. **Login**: Use admin credentials to access admin dashboard
2. **Add Students**: Register new students with photos and face data
3. **View Statistics**: Monitor attendance statistics and student lists
4. **Configure Settings**: Toggle student authentication features

### Student Operations
1. **Login**: Use roll number to access student dashboard
2. **Mark Attendance**: Use face recognition to mark daily attendance
3. **View History**: Check personal attendance history and statistics

## Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks on admin login
- **Face Verification**: Ensures attendance is marked by the actual student
- **Session Management**: Proper session cleanup and validation
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Face Recognition Not Working**:
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check internet connection for model loading
   - Verify face is clearly visible and well-lit

2. **Admin Login Issues**:
   - Check rate limiting status
   - Verify Appwrite credentials
   - Ensure proper network connectivity

3. **Photo Upload Failures**:
   - Verify Appwrite storage configuration
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure proper bucket permissions

### Performance Tips

1. **Face Recognition**:
   - Use good lighting for better accuracy
   - Ensure face is centered and clearly visible
   - Avoid rapid movements during capture

2. **Network Optimization**:
   - Use stable internet connection
   - Consider caching frequently used data
   - Optimize image sizes before upload
